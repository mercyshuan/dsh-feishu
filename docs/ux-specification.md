# UX Specification

English | [中文](ux-specification.zh.md)

This document specifies the user-facing behavior of dsh-feishu precisely
enough that a developer can implement each part without inventing details,
and a user can predict what the bot will do. Every part is derived from a
reference implementation — the DSH web chat (packages `ui-conversation`,
`ui-tool` in deepseek-harness) or botmux (`card-builder.ts`,
`card-handler.ts`, `event-dispatcher.ts`) — and the derivation is cited.

**Rule (user directive): no truncation without asking.** Any feature that
would cut user-visible content (card size, list length, output length) must
first confirm the approach with the user. This spec lists the physical
limits that exist; every one of them is a question, not a silent default.

---

## 1. The streaming turn card

### 1.1 Layout (top → bottom)

Reference: DSH web message flow (think rows → tool rows → answer), plus
user feedback rounds 2–5.

1. **Row sequence** — a chronological list of one-line rows. Two kinds:
   - **Think row**: `☁️ Think · Thinking` while the reasoning block streams;
     the line never changes after settle (a live latest-line would flicker
     through throttled patches for little value — user decision).
   - **Tool row**: `<status> <Title> · <summary>` where status is `🔧`
     (running), `✅` (done), `❌` (error); Title and summary come from
     Section 2.
2. **The complete answer** — the turn's final output, markdown-rendered
   (Section 4), at the bottom.
3. **Execution status** — while working, a markdown line `**… working**` /
   `**⏹ Stopping…**` (visible progress); in a terminal state, a quiet
   `note` (`✅ Done` / `⏹ Stopped` / `⚠️ Turn ended with an error`) — the
   header template color already carries the semantic (see 1.4).
4. **Button area** — two rows (Section 3.1): state actions, then the row
   view toggle.

The card is **collapsed by default**: the row sequence is replaced by one
line of the model's **CURRENT thinking** — the newest non-empty reasoning
block, flattened onto one line and clipped to its tail
(`MAX_COLLAPSED_THINK_CHARS`, prefixed `…` when clipped). When the turn has
no reasoning text at all (a model that emits none, or a turn that went
straight to tools), the line falls back to the latest row's own line so the
folded card still says what is happening. The button area gains `▸ Expand`.

> Replaced the earlier row-name trail `think → bash → read → …` (user
> feedback): a column of tool names says which tools ran, not what the model
> is thinking.

### 1.2 Card state machine (single authoritative state)

Reference: user feedback rounds 4–6 (collapsed default, details click must
not collapse, streaming must continue while collapsed, "card reverted to
working after panel" — the design that replaced ad-hoc per-action patches).

One `ChatCardState` per chat is the **single authoritative source** for the
streaming card: `title`, `content`, `rows`, `openThinkId`, `status`
(working/done/stopped/error), `collapsed`. The streaming-card controller renders the card from this state and
nothing else.

```
(none)  --message/retry-->  working  --turn/end(aborted)-->  stopped
working --stop------------>  (unchanged until turn/end aborts it)
working --turn/end-------->  done | error
working --compaction/end-->  done | error   (compaction is NOT a turn)
done|stopped|error --any action--->  same (state unchanged; card re-synced)
```

- **Entering working**: message or retry sets a fresh state (collapsed by
  default) and opens a new card.
- **Streaming**: session events mutate the working state and call
  `syncCard` (through the streaming manager).
- **turn/end**: `completed` → done, `aborted` (user Stop) → **stopped**,
  `error` → error. An aborted turn must read **Stopped**, never Done (DSH
  web `message.stopped`; user report). `finalize` flushes the terminal
  render. The state stays in the map (rows/content survive for the ⋯
  buttons and later re-sync).
- **Card actions** mutate the state (toggle flips `collapsed`) or not, then
  **always** call `syncCard` — the single render path. A finished card is
  re-patched in place, deferred via a macrotask so the callback ACK lands
  first (botmux rule: Lark can otherwise restore the pre-click card — the
  root of the "reverts to working" bugs).
- **Collapsed**: `collapsed` is part of the state; `▸ Expand`/`▾ Collapse`
  flips it. While collapsed, the thinking line streams (recomputed from the
  rows — the newest reasoning text — on every sync). A new turn resets to
  collapsed.
- **Compaction is not a turn** (user report): `/compact` runs a
  `compaction/start → summary → end` transaction with no `turn/end`, so the
  the streaming-card controller handles the compaction card lifecycle — `compaction/start`
  opens a 🧹 Compacting card (immediate button feedback, not a silent
  wait), `compaction/summary` renders the summary, and `compaction/end`
  finalizes it (done, or error with a failure notice when the transaction
  failed), releasing the working-state gate. A checkpoint `user/message`
  with plugin source `compact` opens a Compacting card as a fallback.
- **No action can leave the card in a stale state**: panel, stop, retry,
  copy, row-details all end with `syncCard`, so the on-screen card always
  reflects the authoritative state.

### 1.3 Streaming mechanics

Reference: botmux streaming card; our `StreamingCardManager`.

- One interactive card per turn, posted at turn start.
- Chunks patch the same message (`im.v1.message.patch`), throttled and
  coalesced (at most one patch in flight; newest snapshot wins).
- Patches are **silent** (no unread) — fine for progress.
- The final answer lives **in the card** (it finalizes green in place); a
  completed turn sends no second bubble. An error turn sends a notice
  text (`⚠️ Turn failed — see the card for details`).
- Card body cap: Feishu ~109 KB. Our `MAX_CARD_CHARS = 60_000` truncation
  is **pending user confirmation** per the no-truncation rule.

### 1.4 Visual language

- Header template per status: `wathet` (soft blue) working, `green` done,
  `red` error, `orange` stopped.
- Terminal status is a quiet `note` (not a bold line); in-progress stays a
  markdown line.

### 1.5 Turn lifecycle

| Event | Card behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `turn/start` (via message) | open card, status working |
| `assistant/chunk` text-delta | append to answer, patch |
| `assistant/chunk` reasoning-delta | append to open think row, patch |
| `tool/call` | settle open think row; add tool row (running) |
| `tool/result` | mark the matching tool row done/error, store result |
| `assistant/message` | replace answer with assembled text |
| `turn/end` | settle think row; status done/error; finalize card; keep snapshot + rows for re-assertion and the ⋯ buttons |
| `compaction/start` | open a 🧹 Compacting card, status working (a compaction transaction is not a turn) |
| `compaction/summary` | replace the card answer with the compaction summary |
| `compaction/end` | status done (or error, with a failure notice, when the transaction failed); finalize the card — releases the working-state gate |

---

## 2. Tool row model (Title · summary)

Reference: DSH web `tool-call-model.ts` (`toolRowModel`, `classifyTool`,
`VARIANT_TITLES`, `TOOL_TITLES`, `SUMMARY_KEYS`) — ported verbatim in
`src/cards/tool-summary.ts`.

### 2.1 Classification

| Tool name(s) | Variant | Title |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bash`, `pwsh` | bash | Bash / Pwsh |
| `read`, `web_fetch`, `cordis_package_inspect`, `cordis_runtime_inspect` | read | Read / Inspect |
| `web_search`, `grep`, `glob` | search | Search |
| `write` | write | Write |
| `edit` | edit | Edit |
| `run_code` | code | Code |
| `job_output`, `job_list`, `job_kill` | read | Read Job / List Jobs / Kill Job |
| unknown | others | Tool call |

### 2.2 Summary derivation

Prefer, in order:
1. the variant's preferred arg key — bash: `description`, `command`;
   read: `path`, `file_path`, `url`, `job_id`; search: `query`, `pattern`,
   `url`; write/edit: `path`, `file_path`; code: `description` — first line
   only;
2. the first string arg value (first line);
3. the raw args string (first line).

Unknown (`others`) tools show `name · <base>`. Workspace-rooted paths are
relativized to the session cwd.

**Key invariant (bug fix `bff5180`):** the summary is derived from the
**full** arguments at `tool/call` time and stored on the row. Truncating
the stored args for card size must never degrade the visible summary.

---

## 3. Buttons

Reference: user feedback rounds 1–5; botmux control cards.

### 3.1 Status button area (bottom of streaming card)

Two action rows keep each short on mobile:

- **Row 1 — state actions**
  - **working**: `⏹ Stop turn`.
  - **done**: `📋 Copy`, `🔁 Retry`, `⚙️ Panel`.
  - **error**: `🔁 Retry`, `⚙️ Panel`.
- **Row 2 — view toggle** (only when rows exist): `▾ Collapse` /
  `▸ Expand`.

### 3.2 Row ⋯ buttons

Each row (think and tool) has a trailing `⋯` button that opens that exact
row's **details card** (Section 5). The button value carries the stable row
id (`think-N` or the tool `callId`), never an index.

### 3.3 Action → behavior

| Action | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `stop` | `agent.cancel({kind:'user'}, {keepInbox:true})` (the DSH web Stop) + `⏹ Stopping…` text. No live agent → explanatory text. |
| `copy` | resend last output as text |
| `retry` | re-deliver last prompt on a fresh turn/card |
| `panel` | open the panel card (stop/retry/copy) |
| `toggle-rows` | flip collapsed bit; re-render (deferred patch) |
| `row-details` | open the row's details card; re-assert streaming card |
| `repo-pick` / `repo-page` | repo picker (Section 6) |

### 3.4 Card-callback ACK (critical, botmux rule)

`card.action.trigger` is a synchronous callback with a **3 s deadline and
no re-push**. The handler must ACK with a valid response:
- return `{}` (valid ACK, no UI update) — **never `undefined`**, which the
  client rejects as invalid and can then re-render the card to a stale
  state (the "card reverted to Stop after opening details" bug);
- card-changing work must be **deferred out of the callback** (macrotask)
  so the ACK lands before the patch.

---

## 4. Markdown rendering

Reference: botmux `md-card.ts` (markdown-it), our `cards/markdown.ts`.

Feishu lark_md supports a subset of CommonMark. Our converter:

- `#`/`##`/… headings → **bold** (`lark_md` has no heading syntax; raw `#`
  would leak as text);
- fenced code blocks → preserved (blank-line normalized);
- `---` → `hr` element;
- GFM tables → native Feishu `table` element (botmux
  `buildTableFromTokens`; the v1 root-elements layout supports `table` —
  root-level only, matching our card shape; lark_md cells keep inline code
  and bold). Raw `| … |` source text never leaks;
- HTML → stripped (`html: false`).

This is why final answers render (feedback round 1: raw `###` text on the
card was the bug; round 8: tables showed raw pipe text).

---

## 5. Details cards

Reference: user feedback rounds 1, 3, 5.

- **Think details**: the full reasoning text in a code block.
- **Tool details**:
  - header `✅ **<Title>** — <tool name>`;
  - `IN` — the **full** args, pretty-printed JSON in a `json` code block
    (raw text when unparseable);
  - `OUT` — the **full** result in a code block.
- **No truncation** (user directive): the 2000-char details cut and the
  300-char store cut were both removed. Physical card cap is the only
  remaining limit and is a pending question.

---

## 6. Repo picker

Reference: botmux `buildRepoSelectCard` / `project-scanner.ts`, feedback
rounds 1–5.

- `/repo` scans `repoRoots` recursively (depth 3, skip dot/dependency
  dirs, git-common-dir dedup, budgets) and posts a picker card.
- ≤ 50 projects: a `select_static` dropdown **directly inside an `action`
  container** (a `form` placement is silently dropped by Feishu). Option
  label = **repoRoot-relative path** + `(branch)` — never the bare
  basename (generic names like `source` are meaningless alone).
- \> 50: numbered buttons with prev/next pagination.
- **Picker lifecycle**: a pick patches the picker card to a static
  confirmation (no actions) and records the message id; callbacks from a
  superseded picker are rejected (stale-picker guard).
- `repo-pick` reads the chosen path from `action.option` (dropdown) or
  `value.path` (button).

---

## 7. Acceptance checklist (run before declaring a UX part done)

1. Cards start collapsed; the current-thinking line streams while collapsed.
2. Opening row details never collapses or re-renders the streaming card to
   a stale state (toggle bit untouched; re-assertion deferred).
3. Card actions ACK `{}` (never `undefined`); card patches are deferred out
   of the callback.
4. Tool summaries never show raw JSON envelopes for long commands.
5. Details cards show full args/result.
6. Repo dropdown shows relative paths; picker is consumed after a pick;
   stale picker callbacks are ignored.
7. Every step has a unit test; state-machine transitions are covered as
   explicit tests (see `tests/bridge.spec.ts` UX state machine block).

## 8. Command surface

### 8.1 Command set (20 commands: 15 surface + 5 web wrappers)

Every command is a `SurfaceCommand`: one handler shared by the slash line
and the panel button (button = command, botmux `/list-slash-command`
palette idea). `category` groups the panel palette.

| Command | Category | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `/help` | system | list all surface commands + passthrough note |
| `/status` | system | chat/session/agent/last-output/mention line |
| `/cancel` | session | stop the current turn |
| `/cd <path>` | session | set the chat's working directory, rebind a fresh session |
| `/repo [<path>]` | session | project picker card (dropdown ≤ 50, buttons + pages above) |
| `/group [<name>]` | chat | create a group with the bot and sender |
| `/sessions` | session | sessions picker card: a **dropdown** of saved sessions (title · id, ★ current / ● live badges); picking opens the session detail sub-view (Resume / Rename / Archive / Export) |
| `/feishu-status` | system | **surface diagnostic card**: app id, live long-connection state (`✅ ready` / `⚠️ reconnecting` / `❌ error`, `🧪 memory` for the test transport), session count, last inbound activity. Read-only (allowed while a turn runs) |
| `/schedule` | system | list this chat's **active reminders** (folding the session log with the dsh-schedule pure functions; degraded to a hint when the package is absent). Reminders are created in chat by the agent through its `schedule_create`/`schedule_delete`/`schedule_list` tools — no surface command needed |
| `/model` | system | **model picker card** (catalog from `ctx.llm` `listProviders` × `listModels`, current preselected); a pick sets the default for new sessions. `/model <provider>/<model>` sets it directly. Surface-native — the web `/model` is a client popup with no host command |
| `/export` | system | send this chat's session log as a **file message** (`session-<id>.md` markdown transcript from `ctx.sessionQuery.readSession`) — the Feishu equivalent of the web's browser-download `/export` |
| `/panel` | system | open the control panel card from any chat (slash line only — its palette button is hidden, since a palette button that opens the panel would be the panel launching itself) |
| `/resume [<id>]` | session | resume a saved session; no id opens the `/sessions` picker |
| `/clear` | session | start a fresh conversation — **non-destructive**: the previous session stays saved and resumable (content-integrity rule) |
| `/new` | session | alias of `/clear` (web/cc-tui "new chat" parity) |
| `/plan` `/goal` `/compact` `/feedback` `/permission` | system | **dsh web wrappers**: ensure a session/agent, then execute the harness command through `ctx.commands.execute` (dsh-base mounts all five); error kinds surface as ⚠️. Two are state-aware (below): a bare `/plan` toggles plan mode, and `/permission` opens a preset picker. |

The web's `/export` command itself is a browser-download observer
(`dsh-session-log-export` — "Register the Web-only `/export` command that
the browser download plugin observes"), so Feishu implements its own
surface-native `/export` that uploads the transcript as a file message
(`im.v1.file.create` → `msg_type: 'file'`). Likewise the web `/model`
popup is a client-side contribution (`commandUi.popupSelect`) with no host
command — Feishu gets a surface-native `/model` picker instead. Unknown
slash lines keep the passthrough/fallback path.

### 8.2 Stateful web wrappers (/plan toggle, /permission picker)

The bare harness forms of `/plan` and `/permission` cannot *choose* or
*toggle*: `/plan` with no args only enters plan mode, `/permission` with no
args only reports the current preset. A button press must be able to switch
(user report) — so the two wrappers are state-aware:

- **`/model` (no args, or the panel button)** opens a **model picker card**:
  the catalog comes from `ctx.llm` (`listProviders` × `listModels` — the
  deepseek adapter ships a static default catalog, so no network), a
  `select_static` dropdown with the current model preselected via
  `initial_option` (paginated buttons beyond the option cap), and a note
  spelling out `★ current`. A pick sets the default for new sessions
  through `ctx.agentDefaultModel.saveSelection`. Stale picks rejected;
  picks refused while a turn runs. Without `ctx.llm` a bare `/model`
  degrades to the text display (loud log).
- **`/permission` (no args, or the panel button)** opens a **preset picker
  card** built from the real `ctx.permissionPresets` service (mounted by
  dsh-base): a `select_static` **dropdown** (repo-picker pattern — inside an
  `action` container, never a `form`) listing every switchable preset
  (`names` + `optionOf` labels), with `initial_option` preselecting the
  current preset (omitted when the effective state is `custom` — no table
  option). A quiet note spells out the current preset (`★ current: …`).
  Choosing applies through `service.set(agent.session, preset)` — the
  callback's `option` field carries the preset — and replies
  "switched to …". Stale picks from a superseded picker card are rejected;
  picks while a turn runs are refused (working-state gate). Typed
  `/permission <preset>` passes through to the harness command. Without the
  service the wrapper degrades to the harness report text (loud log).
- **`/plan` (no args, or the panel button)** **toggles** plan mode through
  `ctx.planMode`: reads `get(agent)` and `set(agent, !active)`, mirroring
  the harness outcome wording ("Plan mode on…" / "Plan mode off.",
  queued/cancelled variants). Pressing again leaves plan mode. `/plan off`
  and `/plan <message>` pass through unchanged. Without the controller the
  bare form falls back to the harness behavior (loud log).

### 8.3 Working-directory gate (DSH unavailable until a repo is chosen)

A chat with no **explicitly pinned** working directory (/repo pick or
`/cd`) is unavailable: every turn is refused with guidance ("No working
directory chosen yet — send /repo or /cd"), no session/card is created and
the message is not remembered. The deployment `defaultCwd` fallback is
never an implicit choice — a fresh chat or a brand-new group must pick a
repo before DSH works there (user requirement). `requireWorkingDir`
(default true) disables the gate for deployments that want the fallback.

- Read-only commands (`/help /status /sessions /panel` and the
  pickers) stay usable unpinned; the panel surfaces "No working directory —
  pick one with /repo or /cd first".
- `/clear` keeps the pinned directory (only the session rebinds).
- **Resume adopts the session's working directory**: the /sessions Resume
  button carries the session's cwd in its value, and a typed `/resume`
  looks it up from the session list — so a resumed session stays usable in
  the new chat (otherwise the gate would refuse every follow-up).

### 8.4 Working-state gate (state-machine rule)

While a turn is running (`cardStates[chatId].status === 'working'`), only
read-only commands may run: `/help`, `/status`, `/feishu-status`, `/schedule`, `/sessions`
(read state), `/cancel` (the stop itself), `/group` (separate chat),
`/model` (picker — picks are refused mid-turn, but opening it is fine),
`/panel` (the panel carries Stop). Every other command —
`/cd /repo /clear /new /resume` and the five web wrappers — is refused with
"a turn is running — stop it first." The gate lives in `handleCommand` and
the panel `command` action (one rule, two entry points), so a mid-turn
session rebind/remint can never corrupt the live card.

### 8.5 Session lifecycle commands

- **Panel cards are independent state machines.** A typed slash command
  (`/model /repo /permission /sessions /cd` bare) opens its OWN fresh card
  seeded with the view — it never pilots/updates an earlier panel card. A card
  with a parent (its panel stack is deeper than one) renders `⬅ Back`; a
  typed-command card is a standalone root (depth one) and shows **no Back**.
  A completed pick/command on a standalone card **stays** on its result (it
  does not jump back to the panel menu); only a navigation card can pop back.

- `/sessions` is a **dropdown picker** (mobile-friendly, user requirement —
  no long list, no pagination): a `select_static` whose options are the
  sessions (`title ★ ● · id`), capped at `SESSION_SELECT_MAX = 50` (Feishu's
  real select_static option cap) with a `note` explaining the remainder.
  A **🔎 Find session** button opens an input sub-view: typing an id or
  title fragment filters the list, so ANY session is reachable past the cap.
  Selecting an option opens the **session detail sub-view** inside the panel
  card (stack push); the choice arrives in the callback's `option` field.
- `/sessions` + `/resume` data: `ctx.sessionQuery` (mounted by dsh-base's
  `session-query-sqlite`), `listSessions()` newest-first + batch
  `readTitleSnapshots()` for titles. When the service is absent the surface
  degrades to a bound-sessions-only listing (loud log).
- Session detail sub-view (`🗂️ Session`): the session's info (title, id,
  cwd, created age, message count, last answer) plus **Resume** (hidden for
  the current session), **Rename**, **Archive** (or **Restore** when
  archived — `ctx.workspaceRegistry.archiveSession` is reversible), **Export**,
  and **Back** (stack pop). Rename/Archive exist only when the host
  `sessionTitle` / `workspaceRegistry` seams are mounted (the bundle's
  storage×3 + workspace rows; they degrade loudly if absent).
- Resume flow (shared by `/resume <id>` and the detail's Resume button):
  the chat must be idle; the target session must not be running in another
  chat ("has an active turn — stop it in its chat first"); resuming the
  chat's own session reads "already active". Then `SessionMap.set` rebinds
  (the previous binding detaches — 1:1 chat↔session model) and
  `agents.resume` loads a persisted agent when none is live. A failed
  resume (no persisted log) reports ⚠️ and leaves the map untouched.
  Resume does **not** change the chat's pinned cwd (`/cd` owns that), and it
  resets the card state so history is never replayed into a card.
- `/clear`/`/new`: `SessionMap.remint` + full card-state reset (no live
  card, no copy/retry targets). The old session stays persisted → still
  listed by `/sessions` and resumable.

### 8.6 Panel palette and the panel state machine

The panel is a **state machine**, not a stateless re-post — and the
authoritative view stack is **PER CARD, not per chat**: `PanelController`
keeps `Map<chatId, Map<messageId, PanelView[]>>` (menu root at the bottom)
with one render path (`renderPanelView`). Each panel card owns its own stack,
so a button on a card PUSHES / POPs / REPLACEs THAT card's stack and renders
THAT card in place — tapping an old card updates that card, never a different
one (user report: "tap this card, another card reacts"). A card left on
screen from before a daemon restart starts at the menu root when first tapped.
A button PUSHES a sub-view (`input` form, `confirm`, `sessions`,
`session-detail`, `picker`); Back POPS; completion/refusal pops to the menu
root (or back to the detail after a rename). Every transition updates the
same card in place (patch); when an update fails the card is reposted and the
new id recorded. `/panel` and slash commands that open a view
(`openPanel` / `openPanelView`) post a FRESH card with a reset stack — earlier
panel cards stay on screen and keep working independently, the chat never
"swaps" one card for another. Slash-line commands update the chat's most
recently posted panel card (`latestPanelCardId`); card callbacks always
update their OWN card.
Async-data views (`sessions`, `session-detail`, `picker`) post a **⏳
Loading… placeholder** (Back only) FIRST, then the real card — the callback
must carry a panel patch immediately, or Lark restores the pre-click (menu)
card while the data loads and the panel visibly reverts mid-transition (user
report: sessions/detail "退回菜单"). A render failure resets the stack to the
menu root and reposts the menu card, so page flips and Back never go dead
(user report: after a render failure "换页按钮不再有反应").

- Menu (`⚙️ dsh-feishu panel`): `buildPanelCard(statusLine, running,
  commands, page)` — the core row (Stop while running / Retry / Copy) stays
  first; below it the full command palette, grouped by category with emoji
  headers (`🧩 Session` / `💬 Chat` / `⚙️ System`), `PANEL_PAGE_SIZE = 8`
  buttons per page, a quiet `note` page indicator (`Commands · page 1/2`),
  and ◀️/▶️ nav hidden at the bounds. Each button stamps `{kind:'command',
  name}` and executes the same handler as the slash line. The status line
  carries the chat's session context (`session `id` · `cwd``).
- **Input sub-view** (`📁 Change working directory`, `👥 Create group`,
  `🎯 Goal`, `💬 Feedback`, `✏️ Rename session`): a root-level `form` with
  one `input` and a `form_submit` button that carries a `name` (Feishu
  rejects nameless form buttons — ErrCode 200530). The label lives outside
  the form; submitting runs the command with the typed value and pops to
  the menu.
- **Confirm sub-view** (`✨ New chat`, `🧹 Compact`): the destructive action
  states its consequence; confirming runs the command and pops to the menu.
- **Result cards (the panel principle, user requirement).** Panel actions
  whose outcome is FINAL leave the panel as a NEW pure-information card
  (`✅ Done` / `⚠️ Action failed`, no buttons/inputs): repo/model/permission
  picks, rename, archive, input/confirm submissions, resume, export — and
  every palette command without a sub-view (help, status, plan, surface
  status, …). Intermediate steps (input forms, confirm prompts, pickers)
  stay inside the panel card and update in place — a button that needs more
  interaction jumps the panel, a button that needs none notifies with an
  inert card. ALL completions share one exit (`replyResultCard` +
  `popToMenu`): the exit PATCHES the panel card back to the menu root,
  which is what keeps Lark from restoring the pre-click (page-1) card when
  the callback carried no panel update (user report: a direct-result button
  on page 2 jumped back to page 1).
- **Every panel interaction carries an immediate panel patch (the
  callback-patch guarantee).** Lark restores the pre-click card whenever a
  callback carries no panel update, so ANY await inside a panel action must
  be preceded by a patch. Two structures enforce this — never write a new
  async panel action that awaits before patching:
  - async panel VIEWS (`sessions` / `session-detail` / `picker`) post a
    `⏳ Loading…` placeholder (Back only) FIRST in `showPanel`, then the
    real card;
  - async panel OPERATIONS (rename, archive, export, resume, the pickers'
    apply step, input/confirm/command handlers) go through the single
    wrapper `runPanelOperation`, which posts an `⏳ Operating…` placeholder
    (no buttons — blocks mis-taps) before the work, then the result card,
    then the completion exit. This was the root of every "panel reverts
    mid-action" bug (user report: sessions-internal operations showed no
    placeholder).

### 8.7 State-machine matrix for the new actions

| Action \ Status | none | working | done | stopped | error |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| command (read-only) | allowed | **allowed** | allowed | allowed | allowed |
| command (mutating) | allowed | **refused** "stop first" | allowed | allowed | allowed |
| resume-session | allowed* | **refused** | allowed* | allowed* | allowed* |
| panel-page | stateless page re-send (no card-state transition) | | | | |

\* plus target-running → refused; target == current → already-active.
All cells ACK `{}` and end in a consistent state through `syncCard`
(existing rule); the matrix is unit-tested in `tests/bridge.spec.ts`
"state machine matrix extension".

## 9. Interactive cards: approvals and questions (Iteration 3)

Reference: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-user-approval` (`approval/request` waterfall,
`ApprovalOutcome`) and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-user-questions`
(`registerProvider`). One shared mechanism — `src/cards/interactions.ts`
(`InteractionRegistry`): a request posts a card, the surface waits for the
card callback (or timeout / abort), and settles exactly once. Late or stale
callbacks (wrong chat/card, already settled, superseded card) are ignored.

### 9.1 Approval card

`approval/request` → the surface maps the agent to its chat
(`sessionMap.chatFor(agent.session.id)`), posts an **approval card**
(`🔐 Approval needed`, orange): the tool name + the asker's reason, with
`✅ Allow once` (primary) and `❌ Reject` (danger) buttons. The card
callback settles `'allowed-once'` / `'rejected'`; the request `signal`
abort or a 5-minute timeout settles `'cancelled'`. After a decision the
card is replaced in place by a static decided card (no buttons — further
taps do nothing), deferred out of the callback ACK. Failure modes are
fail-closed `'unavailable'` with a loud log: unknown chat, card send
failure, or bridge disposal (every pending entry settles `'cancelled'`).

### 9.2 Question card

`ctx.userQuestions.registerProvider` — each `AskUserQuestionItem` becomes a
**question card** (`❓ Question`, wathet):

- **Single-select** (default): one button per option; the first tap is the
  answer.
- **Multi-select**: toggle buttons (the card re-posts with `✅` checkmarks
  on the selected options — the newest card becomes the interaction
  target) plus a `✅ Submit` button that settles with the collected labels.
- **Free-text** (no options): the card asks the user to reply with a
  message; the next plain chat message is captured as the answer (it
  bypasses the working-directory gate and is not a turn). A `✖ Cancel`
  button aborts.

The model reaches questions through the standard `ask_user_question` tool
(`@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-ask-user`), which the web surface mounts via its
standard/code agent presets; this bundle inserts the same tool row into the
profile composition so the Feishu agent has web-parity question capability.

The agent's `signal` abort settles unanswered questions as empty answers.
The answer card becomes a static confirmation.

## 10. Iteration 4: reaction ack, allowlists, proactive mentions

Reference: botmux (`im/lark/client.ts` reactions, `RECEIVED_REACTION_EMOJI_TYPE`
/ `DONE`), DSH web (`/export` file download), and the harness config surface.

### 10.1 Two-stage reaction ack

Every accepted turn message gets a **received** reaction immediately (default
`GoGoGo`, the botmux code), tracking `{messageId, reactionId}` per chat. When
the turn settles, the received reaction is **removed and swapped** for the
terminal emoji:

| Turn outcome | Emoji (config `reactions`) | Default |
|---|---|---|
| completed | `done` | `DONE` |
| error | `error` | `WARN` |
| stopped (user Stop) | `stopped` | `WARN` |

Configurable via `reactions.received/done/error/stopped`; `received: ''`
disables the ack entirely. Reaction calls are best-effort: a failure logs and
never blocks the turn. Slash commands and gate-refused messages get no
reaction. `/clear`/`/resume` drop the pending-tracking entry.

### 10.2 Session replay is `/export` only

The session log has exactly one surface: `/export` ships the transcript as a
**file message** (see §8.1). A card-replay command (`/history`) was built and
then **removed by decision**: it duplicated `/export`'s content, and printing
a full history into cards was ugly — the file message is the review surface.

### 10.3 `allowedUsers` allowlist

`allowedUsers` (config; `FEISHU_ALLOWED_USERS` env fallback, comma-separated)
restricts which **sender open ids** the surface serves — the user-level
counterpart of `allowedChats`. When non-empty, messages from unlisted senders
are ignored entirely (logged, no reaction/card/turn), including inside an
allowed chat; card buttons (which are commands) are gated the same way by
`operatorOpenId`. Note `ou_` open ids are app-scoped — the list is per-app.

### 10.4 Proactive @-mentions in groups

The bridge remembers the **last accepted sender** per chat (and its chat
type). When a group needs a specific human — a failed turn's `⚠️ Turn
failed` notice, an approval card, or a question card — the post carries an
`@`-mention of that requester: `<at user_id="…"></at>` in text messages,
`<at id="…"></at>` in card markdown (botmux-proven syntaxes). p2p chats get
no mention (single-user; noise). Unknown requester → no mention, gracefully.

## 11. Scheduled reminders (dsh-schedule)

Reference: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-schedule` (agent-scoped durable reminders over
the session event log). dsh-base does not mount it — the bundle adds the
`schedule` cordis row, so the agent gets the `schedule_create` /
`schedule_delete` / `schedule_list` tools.

### 11.1 Chat-native configuration

"Remind me in 5 minutes" / "remind me at 9:00 daily" — the user asks in
chat and the agent calls the schedule tools; no surface command is needed.
`every` reminders have a 5-minute floor; `after`/`at` are one-shot. Tools
are installed for root agents created after the plugin loads, so existing
chats gain them on a fresh session (/clear or a new chat).

### 11.2 Agent-initiated turns render as cards

A fired reminder wakes the agent, which injects a `user/message` whose
`source.kind` is `'plugin'` (`plugin: 'schedule'`). The streaming-card controller keys on
that marker: a card-less chat receiving a plugin-sourced user message is
an **agent-initiated turn** — the surface opens a fresh `⏰ Reminder` card
and renders the response to completion (green). User-initiated turns are
untouched (their working card state exists before any event); a resume
never replays history (historical user messages carry `source.kind:
'user'`). `/schedule` lists active reminders by folding the session log.

## Part: session-rename-archive

> Session rename/archive via dsh `sessionTitle` + `workspaceRegistry` — the
> host services the dsh web surface uses, so a rename/archive on Feishu is
> visible in the web UI and vice versa (shared durable state, same DSH_HOME).

### Intended behavior

**Trigger** — the session-detail card's ✏️ Rename and 🗂️ Archive buttons,
reachable via `/sessions` → pick a session. Previously these buttons were
hidden in real deployments because the `apiProxy` gateway service is not
mounted by dsh-base; this part replaces that seam with two base/plugin
services that ARE present after this change.

**States & transitions** — the panel view stack is unchanged
(menu → sessions → session-detail → input/confirm → back). What changes is
the mutation seam behind the two actions:

| Action | Old seam (absent in practice) | New seam (present) |
|---|---|---|
| Rename | `apiProxy.sessions.rename` | `ctx.sessionTitle.rename(session, title)` (dsh-base) |
| Archive | `apiProxy.workspace.archiveSession` | `ctx.workspaceRegistry.archiveSession(sessionId)` (new row) |
| Archived list | `apiProxy.workspace.list()` | `ctx.workspaceRegistry.archivedSessionIds` |
| Restore | archive toggle | workspace registry has no unarchive verb → restore = remove from the archived set via the same durable domain |

**Card/panel shape** — unchanged cards; the buttons now render in real
deployments. `canMutateSessions` flips from `apiProxy !== undefined` to
`sessionTitle !== undefined || workspaceRegistry !== undefined`.

**Failure modes**:
- `sessionTitle` absent → rename action reports unavailable (degrade loudly)
- `workspaceRegistry` absent → archive action reports unavailable
- session not live (daemon restarted, no agent) → rename needs a live
  Session; degrade with a clear message (resume first)
- archive of an unknown session → workspace throws
  `WorkspaceUnknownSessionError` → surface the message
- callback deadline / invalid ACK → existing panel rules apply
  (`runPanelOperation`, patch-first)

**Acceptance**:
- With the new bundle rows, the detail card shows Rename + Archive
- Rename persists (`session/title` event) and shows in the sessions list
- Archive moves the session to the archived list; restore brings it back
- Integration test asserts the buttons exist AND the actions work against
  the real dsh process (the old test degraded silently — this must not)
- Feishu and web observe each other's rename/archive (same storage domain)

### Reference

- `@deepseek-ai/dsh-session-title` — `rename(session, title)` appends
  `session/title` (harness `packages/session/session-title`).
- `@deepseek-ai/dsh-workspace` — `archiveSession` + `archivedSessionIds`,
  persisted through `storageDomain` (harness `packages/workspace/workspace`).
- `@deepseek-ai/dsh-storage-domain` — durable KV domain backing the
  workspace registry; web-app bundle mounts storage ×3 + workspace
  (`packages/bundle/web-app/cordis.patch.yml`).**


## Part: inbound-attachments

> Inbound images/files from Feishu are no longer ignored: images are injected
> into the agent's user message (the model sees them), files surface as a
> receipt card with the agent informed by name.

### Intended behavior

**Trigger** — an `im.message.receive_v1` event whose `message_type` is
`image` or `file` (the surface today only accepts `text`). The message may
arrive in a p2p chat or a group (mention gate applies exactly as for text).

**Message normalization** — `normalizeMessageEvent` learns two more types:

| message_type | content JSON | Normalized |
|---|---|---|
| `image` | `{"image_key": "img_v2_…"}` | `text: ''`, one image attachment |
| `file` | `{"file_key": "file_v2_…"}` | `text: ''`, one file attachment |

`FeishuMessage` gains an optional `attachments` array
(`{kind:'image'|'file'; key: string; name?: string}`). A message whose
`message_type` is a KNOWN but unhandled Feishu type (folder, sticker,
share_chat, share_user, system, media, merge, interactive) normalizes with
`unsupportedType` set, and the bridge replies with a loud notice instead of
dropping it silently — a user sending a folder must learn the bot cannot
process it (folder contents are not downloadable via the API). Unknown
types (not in the platform's vocabulary) stay ignored. A mixed message is
not a Feishu concept — each message is one type.

**Unified attachment path (every attachment is a file)** — a Feishu image
is a plain file to the agent: it is downloaded through the message-resource
endpoint (`im.v1.messageResource.get` — `/messages/{message_id}/resources/{image_key}?type=image`;
`im.v1.image.get` can only fetch bot-uploaded images, so user-sent images
MUST use the message-resource API; needs the existing `im:resource` scope),
then saved into the same attachment bucket as files and read by path with
the agent's workspace tools. There is NO image content block / visual-input
path — a bare image message registers as pending like a bare file
(inbound-wait-instruction part), and the agent reads the saved file. This
mirrors the decision that the DSH web paste-image-into-inputbox capability
has no meaningful Feishu equivalent.

**File path (save to the workspace, agent reads by path)** — the agent
cannot ingest arbitrary file bytes as a content block (the attachment
domain is image-only), but it CAN read files under its working directory
(its bash/read tools run under the fs sandbox, which permits
`workspace-write` inside the workspace root). The bridge therefore:
1. streams the file body through the message-resource endpoint
   (`im.v1.messageResource.get` — `/messages/{message_id}/resources/{file_key}?type=file`;
   `im.v1.file.get` can only fetch bot-uploaded files, so user-sent files
   MUST use the message-resource API). Streamed, not buffered — the
   resource API serves files up to ~100 MB; the leading bytes are peeked
   for extension sniffing and pushed back, so the full body pipes straight
   to disk (`pipeline()`; botmux's `downloadWithAppToken` lesson);
2. saves them under the chat's working directory at
   `<cwd>/.dsh_feishu/attachments/<appId>/<chatId>/<name>.<ext>` — a
   hidden subdirectory so uploads never pollute the workspace root,
   bucketed per app + chat. The name is the user's ORIGINAL `file_name`
   (Feishu file events carry it; parsed into `attachment.name`),
   sanitized for path safety (separators, traversal segments, control and
   Windows-reserved characters replaced; Unicode kept; 200-byte cap), and
   deduped WeChat-style — a same-named file re-sent in the same chat lands
   as `name(1).ext`, `name(2).ext`, … never an overwrite. Bucketing per
   chat (not per message) is what makes the dedupe fire; when no
   `file_name` survives sanitization the resource key is used (sanitized,
   same dedupe). Files are kept permanently — the agent can re-read them
   any time, and they are visible to the same tools that see the rest of
   the workspace;
3. posts a small `📎 File received` receipt card (name/extension + path);
4. injects a text note with the REAL path:
   `[user sent a file: <name>.<ext> — saved at <cwd>/.dsh_feishu/attachments/<appId>/<chatId>/<file>]`
   so the model can read it (e.g. `read` the file, grep it, run a script
   over it).

There is no downloadable URL for a Feishu `file_key` — the workspace file IS
the deliverable. A file whose download/save fails still posts the receipt
with a loud log and runs the turn text-only (an attachment never wedges the
chat).

**States & transitions** — this feature has NO new state machine: it feeds
the existing turn pipeline. The only new branch is inside
`deliverTurn` (build the content blocks before `createUserMessage`):

| Step | Attachment (image / file unified) |
|---|---|
| Download | image → message-resource (image) → bytes; file → message-resource (file) → stream + head (sniff) |
| Save | unified stream/bytes to `cwd/.dsh_feishu/attachments/<appId>/<chatId>/<name>.<ext>` (host seam, WeChat dedupe) |
| Content | `[text note with the saved path]` (no image content block) |
| Card | `📎 File received` receipt card |
| Failure | degraded receipt + loud log; turn / follow-up unaffected |

**Card/panel shape** — no new panel views. The receipt card is a plain
markdown card (like the approval/question notices), posted before
`beginTurn` so it never interferes with the streaming card.

**Failure modes**:
- message-resource download fails (scope missing, key expired):
  log loudly, post a degraded receipt (no path), and — for a bare attachment
  message — nothing registers (the follow-up text still works normally); a
  broken attachment never wedges the chat.
- File save to the workspace fails (cwd unwritable, path collision): loud
  log, receipt card still posted, pending entry is name-only.
- Group bare attachment without mention: bypasses the gate (registers
  pending — see the inbound-wait-instruction part); group TEXT still gated.
- Stale/unknown `image_key`/`file_key` at download time: same as download
  failure.

**Acceptance checklist**:
- [ ] `image` message → bytes saved under
      `cwd/.dsh_feishu/attachments/<appId>/<chatId>/`, receipt card posted,
      agent's message carries the REAL saved path (unit + integration tested)
- [ ] `file` message → bytes saved under
      `cwd/.dsh_feishu/attachments/<appId>/<chatId>/`, receipt card posted,
      agent's message carries the REAL saved path (unit + integration tested)
- [ ] A same-named file re-sent in the same chat saves as `name(1).ext`
      (WeChat-style dedupe, integration tested)
- [ ] The saved file is readable by the agent's tools (integration test
      asserts the file exists on disk at the noted path)
- [ ] No image content block is ever injected (a Feishu image is a plain
      file to the agent) — regression
- [ ] Download failure → degraded receipt, nothing registers, no wedge
      (unit-tested)
- [ ] `im:resource` scope reused — manifest unchanged, feishu-setup.md
      description updated

## Part: inbound-wait-instruction

> Bare attachment messages (file OR image — every attachment is a plain
> file to the agent) no longer start a turn by themselves: the bytes land in
> the workspace, a receipt card posts, and the agent waits for the user's
> follow-up instruction (text, or a mention in a group) before it does any
> work. The follow-up message carries every pending attachment into the
> SAME turn, in order.

### Intended behavior

**Trigger** — an inbound message whose `text` is empty AND that carries at
least one attachment (a bare `file` or `image` message; `video` and
rich-text `post` support land in the sibling inbound-rich-text feature and
reuse this pending path). A message that replies to / quotes an earlier
message is EXCLUDED — a quote is itself an instruction and starts its own turn
(the sibling inbound-quotes part). Such a message is *registered* (pending)
instead of delivered: the attachment is downloaded and saved to the workspace
exactly as today, a NEW receipt card posts (the previous ones are kept —
each file gets its own card, traceable in chat history), and NO turn starts.

The pending set is a per-chat list, not a single slot: consecutive bare
attachment messages APPEND (`📎 已收到 N 个文件` on each new card), so the
user can send several files and then one instruction to analyze them all.

**How the follow-up works** — the NEXT inbound message in the same chat that
carries text drains the pending list: the saved-path notes are injected into
that turn's user content BEFORE the text, the list is cleared, and the turn
runs normally. Only the first text message after pending files fires —
later messages see an empty list. A new bare attachment message arriving
while a turn is already running simply appends to the list (the running turn
is unaffected).

**Group mention gate** — attachment messages cannot carry a mention (Feishu
sends a file/image without an input box, so `@bot` is physically
impossible), so the mention gate would otherwise dead-lock group usage: an
un-@ file would be dropped before it could ever become pending. Bare
attachment messages therefore BYPASS the mention gate and always register
(pending only — no work happens, so the gate's safety purpose is preserved:
the agent still never does anything until a gated text instruction follows).
The follow-up TEXT message still passes the normal gate (group text must
@ the bot, or solo-group
relaxation applies) — pending files are only drained by an instruction the
gate would have accepted anyway. p2p chats are unaffected (no gate).

**Feishu message model — one bubble, one message_type** — Feishu messages
are single-type: `text`, `image`, `file`, `video`, or `post` (rich text).
There is no "text + file in one bubble" — a user pasting text and attaching
a file sends two separate messages (which this feature handles naturally:
the file registers, the text drains). The `post` type is the one multi-
element bubble: its content is a 2-D array of inline elements
(`[[{tag:'text'},{tag:'img'},...],[...]]`) that CAN mix text and
attachments (image / media-video / file) in ONE message with an ORDER
that matters ("look at the picture, then read this" vs the reverse). post
support is the sibling inbound-rich-text feature (PR-A); this part's pending
path is what a text-less post's attachments will drain into.

**States & transitions** — one authoritative per-chat object,
`pendingInbound`:

| From | Event | To | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | bare attachment message (p2p / solo / any group) | pending list non-empty | download+save each attachment; NEW receipt card (`📎 已收到 N 个文件`); NO turn |
| pending non-empty | text message, gate passed | pending drained, turn runs | inject saved paths in order before text; clear list; normal turn |
| pending non-empty | another bare attachment message | pending grows | append; another NEW card (count N+1); still no turn |
| pending non-empty | slash command | unchanged (command handles it; list stays) | command runs normally |
| pending empty | text message | (no change) | normal turn, no injection |
| — | message fails download/save | not registered | loud log + degraded receipt (existing behavior); never wedges |
| — | working-directory gate refuses the follow-up text | pending stays | existing refusal notice; user re-sends instruction after /cd |

The pending object is NOT persisted across restarts — a restart drops it
(the files remain on disk; the user re-sends an instruction and, because
the list is empty, the files are not re-attached — acceptable: the paths
are visible in the kept receipt cards, and the agent can be pointed at
them by path).

**Concurrency** — the message channel delivers a burst without awaiting
(`drainInbox` calls the handler back-to-back), so `registerPending` appends
its placeholders to the chat's pending list SYNCHRONOUSLY before any await,
and later mutates them in place. Two concurrent bare-attachment messages
each see the other's entries — a read-then-set around an await would
silently drop one of them.

**Card/panel shape** — the existing `buildInboundFileCard` gains a count:
the markdown body shows `📎 已收到 N 个文件` when more than one file is
pending (count 1 for a single file), listing the just-added file + its
path. The card still shows the saved path and the "send an instruction"
hint. NO action buttons (a button was considered and rejected: it makes
the interaction ambiguous — "do I type or tap?"; the single mental model
is "type the instruction"). Each file posts its OWN card — the previous
cards stay in chat history. No panel views.

**Failure modes**:
- Download/save fails for a bare attachment: existing loud-degrade path
  (receipt posts with a notice, nothing registers, no turn) — a broken
  attachment never wedges the chat.
- Follow-up text refused by the working-directory gate: pending list is
  kept (the user fixes /cd and re-sends); the refusal notice explains.
- Group follow-up text not @-ing the bot: existing gate drops it, pending
  stays — the user must @ the bot to trigger.
- Mid-turn new bare attachment message: appends to pending; the running
  turn is unaffected (no double delivery).
- (PR-A, inbound-rich-text) post parse fails: falls back to a text-only
  notice; `md` absent: element-array serialization is the fallback.

**Acceptance checklist**:
- [ ] Bare file message → file on disk, NEW receipt card, NO turn (mock LLM
      receives nothing) — unit + integration
- [ ] Bare image message → image on disk (sniffed extension), NEW receipt
      card, NO turn — unit + integration
- [ ] Two bare attachment messages → two files on disk, two cards
      (count 1, 2), still no turn — integration
- [ ] Follow-up text message → ONE turn whose user content carries BOTH
      saved paths in order, then the list clears — integration
- [ ] Follow-up in a group must @ the bot; un-@ text keeps the list —
      integration
- [ ] Bare attachment in a group WITHOUT @ registers (bypasses the gate) —
      integration
- [ ] Slash command while pending → command runs, list untouched — unit
- [ ] Failed download → degraded receipt, nothing registers, no wedge — unit
- [ ] No image content block is ever injected (a Feishu image is a plain
      file to the agent) — regression

### Reference

- botmux has NO wait-for-instruction mechanism (files immediately trigger
  processing) — this part is dsh-feishu's own UX, added because a file
  message otherwise starts a turn before the user can say what to do with
  it (user-reported F1.5 issue 1).
- The mention-gate bypass mirrors the reality that Feishu file messages
  cannot carry a mention (no input box) — the gate still protects the
  actual work (gated text instruction required).
- `im.v1.messageResource.get`: `type=file` covers files, audio, AND video —
  the pending download path reuses the existing file seam for all of them.
- post / video support is the sibling PR-A (inbound-rich-text), which drains
  into this pending path.

## Part: inbound-quotes

> A reply/quote is part of the request. When the user replies to an earlier
> Feishu message, that message's content (its text, and its media as a saved
> file path) is injected into the turn BEFORE the user's own text — the agent
> finally sees WHAT is being replied to, without the user re-pasting it.

### Intended behavior

**Trigger** — an `im.message.receive_v1` event whose `parent_id` is set (the
user replied to / quoted an earlier message, in a p2p chat or a group). Feishu
ships ONLY the parent's id in the event — the body needs a second read — so a
quote is a two-step pipeline whose API half belongs to the transport.

**Resolution (transport)** — `normalizeMessageEvent` records the parent id as
`FeishuMessage.quotedMessageId` (still a pure function: no I/O). The transport
then hydrates `FeishuMessage.quoted` BEFORE handing the message to the bridge:

| Step | Call | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Read | `im.v1.message.get` (`/open-apis/im/v1/messages/{message_id}`, `user_id_type=open_id`) | the parent item: `msg_type`, `body.content`, `sender.id` |
| Parse | `parseMessageBody` — the SAME parser as live inbound messages | `text` + ordered `attachments` (a quoted `post` keeps its `<image N>` placeholders) |
| Non-text type | known-but-unhandled `msg_type` (interactive card, sticker, folder, …) | `unsupportedType`: the TYPE is reported, the raw body never is (a card's JSON is not text) |
| Failure | recalled (`deleted`), empty `items`, API error (scope / not found), unparseable body | `unavailable` carrying the reason |

Failure is DATA, not an exception: once `quotedMessageId` exists, the delivered
message ALWAYS carries `quoted`. A quote is explicit user intent, so it must
reach the agent as "there was a quote I could not read — ask the user to resend
it" instead of vanishing (repo rule: misconfiguration fails loud).

Feishu scopes: the existing `im:message` scope covers the message read —
`src/setup/feishu-manifest.json` is unchanged.

**Delivery (bridge)** — `inboundContent` builds the quote's blocks FIRST, then
the user's own text/attachments:

| Position | Block |
|---|---|
| 1 | one text block wrapping the quote: header `[The user replied to an earlier message from <sender> (<id>) — its content follows]`, the quoted text, one note per quoted attachment, footer `[End of the replied-to message]` |
| 2 | the user's own text (unchanged) |
| 3 | the user's own attachments (unchanged) |

The header/footer exist so the agent can never mistake the quoted body for the
user's own words. Quoted media is downloaded through the message-resource
endpoint keyed by the QUOTED message's id (the resource endpoint is keyed by the
owning message, not the reply) and saved through the existing inbound seam, then
named by REAL path in the quote block: `[quoted file: <name> — saved at <path>.
You can read it with your file tools.]`

**No receipt card for quoted media** — the `📎 File received` receipt belongs to
a file the user sends NOW (inbound-attachments / inbound-wait-instruction). A
quote re-reads something sent earlier; posting a receipt per quote would spam
the chat, so the quoted attachment contributes its path note only. A download
failure degrades to a loud note in the quote block
(`[quoted file: <name> — download failed, the content is not available]`).

**A reply is an instruction, not a pending attachment** — a message that
carries attachments and NO text normally registers as pending
(inbound-wait-instruction) and waits for the user's follow-up. A quoted message
is the exception: quoting an earlier message IS the instruction ("about THAT,
look at this"), so it starts its own turn and the quote is injected into it.

**Group mention gate** — unchanged: a reply is gated exactly like any other
message (group text still must @ the bot, or the solo relaxation applies). A
quote never bypasses the gate.

**States & transitions** — no new state machine: the quote is resolved
per-message (stateless) and folded into the existing turn pipeline.

| From | Event | To | Side effects |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | reply with text | turn runs | quote blocks + user text in one user message |
| — | reply whose parent is a rich-text post | turn runs | quoted text with `<image N>` placeholders + quoted attachments saved by path |
| — | reply whose parent is unreadable | turn runs | quote block naming the reason; user text unaffected |
| — | reply whose parent is a card/sticker | turn runs | quote block naming the type only |
| — | reply with attachments and NO text | turn runs (NOT pending) | quote block + the new attachments saved (their receipt cards post normally) |

**Failure modes**:
- `im.v1.message.get` fails (missing scope, rate limit, parent outside the
  bot's visibility): loud `warn` + `unavailable` in the quote block; the turn
  still runs — a quote never wedges the chat.
- Parent recalled: `deleted` → `unavailable` ('the quoted message was
  recalled').
- Quoted attachment download/save fails: loud log + the degraded path note
  inside the quote block; the user's own turn is unaffected.
- A quote returned inside a queued message (a turn was already running): the
  quote is resolved when the message is queued, so the queued turn keeps it.
- A quote inside a slash command (`/help` as a reply): ignored — commands act
  on the command line, not on quoted context.

**Acceptance checklist**:
- [ ] A reply to a text message injects the quoted text + sender id into the
      turn, BEFORE the user's own text (unit)
- [ ] The quoted message's rich-text post keeps ordered placeholders and
      attachments (unit)
- [ ] A quoted image/file is saved through the inbound seam and named by REAL
      path in the quote block, with NO `📎 File received` receipt card (unit)
- [ ] A quoted attachment whose download fails degrades to a loud note (unit)
- [ ] An unreadable quote (recalled / API error / unparseable) reaches the
      agent as an explicit "could not be read" block, never as silence (unit)
- [ ] A quoted card (interactive) is reported by type (unit)
- [ ] A quoted message with attachments and no text starts its own turn
      instead of registering as pending (unit)
- [ ] A plain message triggers NO extra Feishu API call (unit)
- [ ] `normalizeMessageEvent` still normalizes plain messages to the exact
      same shape (regression: `quotedMessageId` is absent, not `undefined`)
- [ ] `im:message` scope reused — manifest unchanged (feishu-setup.md
      description unchanged)

### Reference

- Feishu `im.message.receive_v1` carries `parent_id` (the replied-to message)
  and `root_id` (the thread root) — the surface follows `parent_id`: it is the
  message the user explicitly quoted.
- `im.v1.message.get` (`GET /open-apis/im/v1/messages/{message_id}`) returns
  `data.items[]` with `msg_type` / `body.content` / `sender.id` / `deleted`;
  the existing `im:message` scope covers it.
- botmux encodes the same intent differently (it forwards the reply's raw
  parent id and leaves resolution to the reader) — resolving the body in the
  transport is what makes the quote usable by the agent.
- `parseMessageBody` is shared with the live inbound path on purpose: a quoted
  `post` must speak the same placeholder/attachment vocabulary as a live one.

## Part: inbound-rich-text

> Feishu rich-text (`post`) and `video` messages are no longer silently
> dropped. A `post` message is normalized into a serialized markdown-ish
> string that PRESERVES the inline element order (text / image / media /
> file in one bubble — "look at the picture, then read this" vs the
> reverse), plus an ordered attachment list; a `video` message is a file
> like any other. Rich-text-with-text posts start a turn immediately (the
> existing mixed path); attachment-only posts and bare videos register as
> pending (the sibling inbound-wait-instruction path).

### Intended behavior

**Trigger** — an inbound message whose `message_type` is `post` (rich text)
or `video` (or `audio` — voice bubbles; the same `type=file` download
path serves them). These were silently ignored: the user's formatted
message (bold / lists / quotes / links / code blocks), video, or voice
vanishes with no receipt, no save, no turn. This feature makes them
first-class.

**Feishu `post` content model** — a rich-text message's `content` is a
2-D JSON array of inline element groups:

```json
{
  "title": "…",
  "content": [
    [ {"tag":"text","text":"First line:","style":["bold"]}, {"tag":"a","href":"…","text":"link"}, {"tag":"at","user_id":"…","user_name":"…"} ],
    [ {"tag":"img","image_key":"img_…"} ],
    [ {"tag":"text","text":"Second line:"}, {"tag":"code_block","language":"PYTHON","text":"print(1)"} ],
    [ {"tag":"media","file_key":"file_…","image_key":"img_…"} ],
    [ {"tag":"hr"} ]
  ]
}
```

Each outer array element is a paragraph; the inner elements are inline and
ORDERED — the order between text and attachments is information. The
official element tags: `text` (with `style`: `bold` / `underline` /
`lineThrough` / `italic`), `a` (link), `at`, `img` (image), `media` (video),
`emotion` (emoji), `hr`, `code_block` (with `language` + `text`), `file`.
The client also authors an `md` field (the markdown source) that already
carries formatting and `![img](image_key)` tokens.

**Normalization — `post` → serialized rich-text + ordered attachments** —
a `post` message normalizes into:

1. a `text` string — the linearized markdown-ish rendering of the inline
   elements, in order, with attachment placeholders inline:

```
First line: **bold** [link](https://…) @User
<image 1>

Second line: ```python
print(1)
```

<video 2>
---
```

   Mapping: `text` styles → `**`/`*`/`~~`/`<u>…</u>`; `a` → `[text](href)`;
   `at` → `@name`; `code_block` → fenced block (language + text); `hr` →
   `---`; `emotion` → its emoji text; `img` → `<image N>`, `media` → `<video
   N>`, `file` → `<file N>`. The `md` field, when present, is the preferred
   source (it already carries formatting + `![img](image_key)` tokens —
   rewritten to `<image N>` placeholders); the element array is the fallback
   when `md` is absent. Each element group is separated by a newline; the
   group order is preserved exactly.

2. an `attachments` array, in placeholder order — each `img`/`media`/`file`
   becomes an attachment (`{kind:'image'|'file', key, name?}`), numbered by
   its placeholder position (1-based). The agent correlates `<image N>` with
   the saved path via the ordered note list (the existing
   `[user sent a file: … — saved at …]` notes).

**`video` / `audio` messages** — `message_type: 'video'` (with `file_key` +
`image_key` cover) and `message_type: 'audio'` (voice bubble, `file_key` +
`duration`) normalize to a single `file`-kind attachment (the media body),
exactly like a bare file message — they register as pending and the
follow-up text drains them. `im.v1.messageResource.get?type=file` serves
files, audio, AND video, so no new download path is needed.

**Routing (reuses the sibling parts)** — after normalization:

- `post` with non-empty text → the existing mixed path: immediate turn, the
  serialized text as the `text` block and the attachments injected in
  placeholder order (the inbound-attachments part's unified path).
- `post` with text empty (attachments only) / bare `video` / bare `audio` →
  the inbound-wait-instruction pending path (receipt card, no turn, drained
  by the follow-up text).
- `post` with neither text nor attachments → ignored with a loud log (no
  usable content).

**Card/panel shape** — none new. Rich-text posts with text use the streaming
card like any text message; attachment-only posts / videos use the existing
`📎 File received` pending receipt cards. No buttons, no panel views.

**Failure modes**:
- `post` content JSON malformed (not parseable): the message degrades to a
  text-only notice with a loud log — the raw content string is NOT delivered
  as agent text (it is machine JSON, useless to the model).
- `md` field absent: element-array serialization is the fallback — never an
  empty agent message when elements exist.
- Unknown element tag: skipped with a debug log (forward-compat — new Feishu
  tags degrade gracefully rather than breaking the parse).
- Attachment download/save fails inside a rich-text post: the sibling
  degraded-receipt path (loud log, name-only note, never wedges).
- `video` / `audio` message with a stale key: same download-failure path.

**Acceptance checklist**:
- [ ] `post` with text + bold/link/code/at → agent's user message carries the
      serialized markdown-ish text with formatting preserved (unit)
- [ ] `post` mixing text + image + video → placeholders `<image 1>` /
      `<video 2>` in order, attachments array in the same order, and the
      saved paths correlate (unit + integration)
- [ ] `post` with text → immediate turn (unit + integration)
- [ ] `post` attachments-only → pending (receipt card, no turn; follow-up
      drains) (integration)
- [ ] `video` message → pending like a bare file, drained by follow-up text
      (unit + integration)
- [ ] `audio` (voice) message → pending like a bare file, drained by
      follow-up text (unit)
- [ ] `post` with `md` field → `md`-based serialization preferred (unit)
- [ ] `post` malformed content → loud log, no crash, message not delivered
      as raw JSON (unit)
- [ ] Unknown tag → skipped with debug log, rest of the post intact (unit)

### Reference

- Feishu message content spec (`open.feishu.cn … message-content-description`):
  `post` content is the 2-D element array with `text`/`a`/`at`/`img`/`media`/
  `emotion`/`hr`/`code_block`/`file` tags and the client-authored `md` field;
  styles are `bold`/`underline`/`lineThrough`/`italic`.
- `im.v1.messageResource.get`: `type=image` covers images AND rich-text
  images; `type=file` covers files, audio, AND video — the existing download
  seams serve every post element and the `video` message, no new endpoint.
- lark-cli's `lark-event-im` reference confirms `post` / `video` are distinct
  `message_type` values alongside `text`/`image`/`file`/`audio`/`sticker`.
- botmux's rich-text handling flattens post content to text only (no
  attachment ordering) — dsh-feishu's ordered-placeholder serialization is
  our own design, preserving the intra-bubble order the user asked for.
- The pending routing reuses the sibling inbound-wait-instruction part
  (drained by the follow-up text; attachment messages bypass the group
  mention gate because Feishu cannot @ from an attachment).

## Part: outbound-files-images

> The agent can send a file or image to the Feishu chat by calling an
> explicit `send_file` tool: it names a workspace path (and optionally a
> description), the surface uploads the bytes through the message-resource
> API and posts a native Feishu image/file message, then reports the send
> back to the agent and shows a small receipt card.

### Intended behavior

**Why active, not passive** — dsh has no host-level "agent produced a file"
event (the web UI's "Turn produced files" is a client-side derivation from
tool cards' `locations`, invisible to a plugin; see the sibling feature
`turn-produced-files`). Rather than guess from `tool/result` or fs
observation, the surface injects a first-class **`send_file` tool** that the
agent calls deliberately when it wants to deliver a file/image to the user.
Active tool invocation is deterministic and self-describing — the agent
knows what it produced and why it sends it, so no heuristics or false
positives.

**Trigger** — an agent calls the `send_file` tool during a turn:
`send_file(path, description?)`.

- `path` (string, required): the file/image to send — an absolute path or a
  workspace-relative path. An absolute path is used as-is; a relative path is
  resolved against the chat's pinned working directory (`cwd`).
- `description` (string, optional): a short, human, English explanation of
  what is being sent; it is shown verbatim as the text line that precedes the
  file (the intro IS this description). Returned to the agent as the tool's
  result context.

**Tool registration** — via dsh's tool runtime: `ctx.get('tools')?.register(defineTool({...}))`
(the feature-detect pattern, mirroring `ctx.commands` / `ctx.watch`). The
registration is in the GLOBAL scope, so every agent can call it. The tool
definition follows the reference `tool-fs` `write` tool:
`ctx.tools.register(defineTool({ name, description, parameters, output, execute }))`.
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools` is added as a runtime dependency (it exports the
`defineTool` helper — a runtime function, not a type-only import).

**Execution** — `execute(args, exec: ToolRunContext)` runs in the host
process (the same one running the surface):

1. resolve `cwd = exec.agent.session.header.cwd` (the chat's pinned working
   directory) and `chatId = sessionMap.chatFor(exec.agent.session.id)`.
2. resolve the send target: an absolute `path` is used as-is, a relative one
   is joined onto `cwd` (`resolveSendPath`) — never re-join an absolute path
   (double-prefix bug). read the bytes; a missing/unreadable file is a tool
   error (loud, no upload).
3. **classify** the type by extension + magic bytes (reuse `sniffExtension`):
   a known image container (png / jpg / gif / webp) → an image message via
   `im.v1.image.create`; any other type → a file message via
   `im.v1.file.create` (already supports binary). Upload the bytes, then
   `createMessage(chatId, 'image'|'file', ...)`.
4. on success, post a short text line: the `description` verbatim when given,
   else `Sending <name>:` FIRST, then the file — no
   receipt card; the intro line IS the affordance. A text-post failure is
   logged and does not fail the tool.
5. return a structured value to the agent (the sent file name + the message
   the user sees), so the agent can acknowledge.

**No chips / auto-collection** — this part is the *transport + tool*
foundation only. The "show each turn's produced files as clickable chips"
UX is the sibling feature `turn-produced-files` and is deliberately out of
scope here.

**Card/panel shape** — no receipt card. The tool posts a short text line
(the `description` verbatim, else `Sending <name>:`) followed by the native
image/file message at the moment the upload succeeds, independent of the
streaming card (which keeps
rendering the turn's tokens). No new panel views, no buttons.

**Failure modes**:
- `tools` service absent (host did not mount it): feature-detect — the
  surface logs loudly and does not register `send_file`, so the agent never
  sees it (never a broken tool). The turn still runs normally.
- Path missing / unreadable / outside cwd: tool error — `{ isError: true }`,
  a loud log, and a clear message to the agent (no partial upload).
- Upload fails (`im.v1.image.create` / `im.v1.file.create` error, auth): tool
  error with the API message; the agent is told it did not send.
- Unsupported file type (no known classifier): falls back to a `file` message
  (the resource API serves arbitrary file bytes); `type=file` covers audio
  and video too.
- Oversized file: the platform's limit is surfaced as a tool error.

**Acceptance checklist**:
- [ ] `send_file` is registered and visible to the agent's tool schema
      (integration: the agent's request body carries the `send_file` tool).
- [ ] Agent calls `send_file({ path, description })` → a native image message
      posts for an image path (png/jpg/gif/webp) and the bytes match
      (unit + integration).
- [ ] Agent calls `send_file` with a non-image path → a native file message
      posts and the bytes match (unit + integration).
- [ ] A short text line (the `description` verbatim, else `Sending <name>:`)
      posts before the file; NO receipt card posts (unit).
- [ ] An absolute `path` is used as-is (not re-joined onto the cwd) and a
      relative one resolves against the cwd (unit).
- [ ] The tool returns a structured value to the agent (name + confirmation)
      (unit).
- [ ] Missing/unreadable path → tool error, no upload, no text line (unit).
- [ ] `tools` service absent → `send_file` not registered, loud log, turn
      still runs (unit).
- [ ] No chips / auto-collection in this part (deferred to
      `turn-produced-files`) — regression guard.

### Reference

- dsh tool runtime `ctx.tools` (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools`): `register(defineTool({...}))`
  — `ToolDefinition` = `ToolSchema` + `output { schema, render }` +
  `execute(args, exec)`; `exec.agent.session.header.cwd` gives the chat's
  working directory, `exec.agent.session.id` the session. Reference
  `packages/fs/tool-fs/src/write.ts` (`ctx.tools.register(defineTool(...))`
  + `execute`).
- Feishu message-resource API: `im.v1.image.create` uploads an image
  (`image_type` + bytes) → `createMessage('image')`; `im.v1.file.create`
  uploads a file (`file_type: 'stream'` + `file_name` + bytes) →
  `createMessage('file')`. `type=file` on the resource API serves files,
  audio, AND video. Existing scope `im:resource` is reused (no new scope).
- botmux's `uploadImage`/`uploadFile` (`src/im/lark/client.ts`) are the
  transport reference for the upload paths; botmux only forwards user-pasted
  attachments (create-session banner), not agent-produced ones — there is no
  agent-produce signal to copy (see sidecar research).
- The surface's existing `transport.sendFile(chatId, fileName, content)`
  (`src/transport.ts`) already uploads + posts a file; `send_file` extends it
  to images and to reading real workspace bytes (not just a string).

## Part: turn-produced-files

> After a turn ends, the streaming card lists the files the agent produced
> (write/edit mutations) as clickable chips; tapping a chip sends that file
> to the chat as a native Feishu image/file message. Mirrors the DSH web
> "Turn produced files" row (same paths, path-level parity).

### Intended behavior

**Why path-level parity, not render-intent parity** — the DSH web UI derives
produced files from the tool-result card's render intent
(`card === 'diff'` or `generic + edit` → `locations[].path`), built by the
browser-only `client-runtime` from each tool's `presentCall`/`presentResult`.
That render-intent data is NOT in the host session event stream — the
surface (a plugin) cannot see `card`/`locations`. The host CAN see
`tool/result`'s `meta` (the tool's private presentation payload) and the
correlated `tool/call` row. So the surface reproduces the SAME *set of
produced paths* (write/edit mutations) by combining both host-visible
sources — path-level parity, same paths the web row lists.

**Host-visible mutation signal** — the fs write/edit mutation tools persist a
`meta.diffs` KEY on `tool/result`: a non-empty `{path, oldText, newText}[]`
for an update/overwrite, an empty list for a new-file CREATE (there is no
before-image to diff). Reads carry a window/snippet meta (NO `diffs` key),
deletes and plain terminal tools carry none — so the presence of a `meta.diffs`
KEY (even an empty array) is the mutation signal, exactly the web's
render-intent rule ("a read looked, a delete removed, a terminal ran").

**Trigger** — a `tool/result` session event whose `meta` has a `diffs` array
key. For a non-empty `diffs`, the FIRST entry's `path` is taken (a mutation
tool touches one file; the row is the file). For an empty `diffs` (a create),
the path is not in meta, so it is derived from the correlated `tool/call`
arguments' `file_path` (the fs write/edit tools name the target there,
matching the web's `presentCall.locations`). No correlated `tool/call` row
and an empty `diffs` → nothing added (never a broken chip).

**State** — `ChatCardState` gains `producedPaths: string[]` (the authoritative
turn-scoped produced-file paths, deduped, in arrival order). It is reset when
a new turn starts (`turn/start`) and filled as `tool/result` events arrive.
`CardSnapshot`/the one render path (`syncCard`) carry it.

**Card/panel shape** — the streaming card's FINAL state (done / stopped /
error) renders a `📎 Produced` row under the last tool/message row: one
button per produced path (label = basename). Tapping a chip sends that file
to the chat via the existing outbound transport (`sendImage` for image
extensions, `sendFile` otherwise — the #29 `send_file` foundation). The chip
is a card action (`value.kind: 'send-produced'`, `value.path`); it does NOT
mutate card state (only sends + a debug log), and the card stays in its
terminal state. Sends a file message only — no extra receipt card (the chips
row IS the affordance).

**Ordering/cleanup** — `producedPaths` is turn-scoped: `turn/start` resets it,
`turn/end` freezes the chip row (the card finalizes with it). A subsequent
turn's mutations replace the previous list. The tools' `meta.diffs[].path` are
ABSOLUTE (the fs write/edit tools report the resolved path), so `send-produced`
accepts an absolute path as-is and only joins a relative one onto the pinned
`cwd` — never re-join an absolute path (the double-prefix bug).

**Failure modes**:
- `meta` absent / `diffs` empty: nothing added (reads, deletes, terminals —
  correct exclusion).
- `meta.diffs` present but malformed (no path): skipped with a debug log
  (never a broken chip).
- Chip click while the file is gone (deleted between turn and click): the
  send fails loudly (tool error surfaced), no partial send, card unchanged.
- Chip click on an unsupported type: `sendFile` handles it (the resource API
  serves arbitrary bytes incl. audio/video).
- No produced paths: no `📎 Produced` row renders (the card looks as today).

**Acceptance checklist**:
- [ ] A `tool/result` with a non-empty `meta.diffs` adds the first path to
      `ChatCardState.producedPaths` (unit).
- [ ] A `tool/result` with an EMPTY `meta.diffs` (a new-file create) adds the
      path from the correlated `tool/call` arguments' `file_path` (unit).
- [ ] A `tool/result` from a read (meta without a `diffs` key) does NOT add a
      path (unit).
- [ ] `turn/start` resets `producedPaths`; `turn/end` keeps the accumulated
      list for the final chip row (unit).
- [ ] The final card renders one `📎 Produced` chip per produced path
      (label = basename) (unit + integration).
- [ ] Tapping a chip sends the file to the chat (image path → image message,
      other → file message) (integration).
- [ ] A chip click never mutates card state (the card stays terminal) (unit).
- [ ] No produced paths → no `📎 Produced` row (unit).
- [ ] Malformed `meta.diffs` / an empty `meta.diffs` without a correlating
      `file_path` skips with a debug log (unit).

### Reference

- DSH web `packages/client/ui-deliverables/src/client/turn-deliverables.ts`:
  `producedPaths(view)` returns `locations[].path` only for
  `card === 'diff'` or `generic + edit` — the render-intent rule this part
  mirrors at path level (client-only per its header, so the host replicates
  the path set from `meta.diffs`).
- dsh agent-loop `packages/core/agent-loop/src/tool-calls.ts`:
  `session.append('tool/result', { ..., meta })` — `meta` is the tool's
  private presentation payload persisted on the session event, carrying the
  fs mutation diffs (write/edit) the surface reads.
- fs tools `packages/fs/tool-fs/src/write.ts` / `edit.ts`: presentCall /
  presentResult return `{ card:'diff', locations:[{path}] }`; `result.meta`
  carries `diffs` (write/edit). read.ts persists a window/snippet meta (NOT
  diffs) — the exclusion signal.
- Surface `src/cards/StreamingCardController.ts` (ChatCardState, `snapshot`,
  `syncCard`) — the single authoritative state + render path this feature
  extends; the `#29` outbound `sendImage`/`sendFile` transport is reused.

## Part: session-stats-context

> On the terminal streaming card, a compact stats line shows the session's
> cumulative turn/step/tool/token usage (exact fields only) plus a context
> occupancy percentage, mirroring the DSH web `StatsLine`/context meter as a
> path-level parity surface. No timing/throughput (TTFT/tok/s/duration) — the
> host cannot see the web's `node.timing`; only exact counted fields.

### Intended behavior

**Why exact fields, not timing** — the DSH web `StatsLine` (`turn-metrics.ts`,
`StatsLine.tsx`) derives TTFT/tok/s/duration from per-node `node.timing`
(`stepStartTime`/`firstTokenTime`/`completedTime`) and a `sessionStats`
whole-log projection — both browser-side. The host plugin sees only the
session event stream, and the events carry `usage: TokenUsage` (input/output/
cacheRead/cacheWrite) but NOT timing. So the surface reproduces the counted
fields exactly (turns/steps/tool calls/tokens/cache-hit) and the context
occupancy (used tokens vs the model's `contextWindow`), and omits any
timing-derived figure (duration, TTFT, tok/s) that would require estimating
from event timestamps.

**Trigger** — a terminal streaming card for a chat that has any session
activity. The line renders on the card's FINAL state (done / stopped / error),
bundled with the other terminal rows (e.g. `📎 Produced` chips). It is NOT
shown while working.

**State** — `ChatCardState` gains a session-scoped accumulator (NOT reset per
turn — it is cumulative for the whole session, mirroring the web's whole-log
`sessionStats`):

- `turnCount` — number of recorded turns (`turn/start` increments).
- `stepCount` — number of assistant steps (`assistant/message` increments).
- `toolCount` — number of tool calls (`tool/call` increments).
- `tokenUsage` — accumulated `TokenUsage` (`assistant/message.usage` summed
  across steps; absent usage contributes nothing).
- `contextWindow` — the chat's current model `contextWindow` (from `ctx.llm`
  resolution) when known; `undefined` until resolved.

`CardSnapshot`/the one render path (`syncCard`) carry it.

**Card/panel shape** — on the terminal card, after the content and alongside
any `📎 Produced` chips, render a single line of `|`-separated groups
(mirroring the web `StatsLine` groups, but only the exact fields):

1. counts — `N turns · M steps` (omitted when no activity).
2. tokens — `input A · output B` (`formatTokens`: 517 / 12.2K / 517K / 1.2M),
   plus `cache X%` when there is billed input.
3. context occupancy — `context P%` when both `usedTokens` and `contextWindow`
   are known (rounded integer, upper-clamped at 100).

Tool-call count is folded into the counts group in parentheses only when a
tool ran (`M steps · T tools`). No timing group is ever shown.

**Failure modes**:
- No session activity yet: no stats line renders (the card looks as today).
- `assistant/message` without `usage`: contributes no tokens (never a zero
  token group on a session whose steps all failed to bill).
- `contextWindow` unknown (model resolution absent/failed): the context
  occupancy group is omitted (only the counts/tokens groups show).
- Chat with no pinned cwd: unaffected (this is a read-only card line, no
  sending, no path resolution).

**Acceptance checklist**:
- [ ] `assistant/message.usage` accumulates into the token totals; a step
      without usage contributes nothing (unit).
- [ ] `turn/start` / `assistant/message` / `tool/call` increment the counts
      correctly; counts are SESSION-scoped (not reset at `turn/start`) (unit).
- [ ] The terminal card renders the counts + tokens (+ cache %) groups only
      for exact fields; never a timing group (unit + integration).
- [ ] Context occupancy group renders when `contextWindow` and usedTokens are
      known, and is omitted otherwise (unit).
- [ ] No activity → no stats line (unit).
- [ ] The stats line is terminal-only (not while working) and does not mutate
      card state (unit).

### Reference

- DSH web `packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/chat/turn-metrics.ts`
  and `StatsLine.tsx`: `deriveTurnMetrics`/`deriveStats` read `node.timing`
  (TTFT/decode) and `sessionStats`/`tokenUsage` projections — the browser-only
  source of timing+token figures. `formatTokens` / `formatDuration` /
  `cacheHitPercent` / `contextOccupancy` give the exact display rules this part
  mirrors for the count/token/context groups (timing groups deliberately
  excluded).
- Installed dsh types: `dsh-session` `SessionEventMap['assistant/message']`
  carries `usage?: TokenUsage`; `dsh-llm` `TokenUsage`
  (`inputTokens`/`outputTokens`/`cacheReadTokens`/`cacheWriteTokens`) and
  `LlmResolvedModelInfo.context.contextWindow` — the host-visible data.
## Part: message-queue

> Messages received while a turn runs no longer interrupt it — they queue
> on their OWN dedicated card, one card per queued message with one lifecycle
> state machine per card (no shared "N queued" card and no recall/re-post
> single-card invariant). Each queued item is steered (injected into the
> running turn), edited, or removed; terminal-item cards are RETAINED showing
> their status marker. Mirrors the DSH web `QueueDock`.

### Intended behavior

**Why one card per queued message, not rows on the streaming card** — the
DSH web surfaces queued input in a `QueueDock` (a fixed element), and the
production concern (user report): a message sent while a turn runs must be
*visibly accepted*, otherwise the streaming card looks "dead" (no bubble under
the user's message). Posting a dedicated card that confirms "queued" makes
acceptance unambiguous. Each queued message is ONE card with its OWN lifecycle
state, so the user can follow a single item from `queued` → `editing` →
`steering` → `steered`/`sent`/`removed` without recalling and re-posting a
shared card. A single shared card was fragile (built with a per-item `form`
+ `input.default_value` — a Feishu 400 — and hard to maintain).

**Trigger** — a user message arriving while the chat's turn is running
(`streaming.isWorking(chatId)`). Such a message is NOT delivered as a new
turn immediately; it is kept in the surface's OWN in-memory queue and posted
as its OWN `buildQueueItemCard` (status `queued`).

**Queue data / state** — the queue is the SURFACE-OWNED, in-memory
`Map<chatId, QueueItem[]>` (never the agent inbox's `nextTurn` list, which the
agent loop auto-claims at its own step boundary and would bypass
`deliverTurn` — the user sees the "Sent" marker but no streaming card). It is
surface-owned (not session-owned), so a card re-render never loses it; not
persisted, so a restart drops queued messages (accepted trade-off). Each item
carries the resolved `UserMessage` (re-deliver / steer), `text`, `status`, and
the original inbound message. Alongside it, the bridge keeps a per-item card
registry `Map<chatId, Map<itemId, { cardMessageId, status, text, message,
feishu }>>` so each item's dedicated card is updated IN PLACE (`updateCard`)
as its lifecycle state changes — even after the item leaves the active queue
(a retained marker card still needs its preview text).

**Item lifecycle states (one state machine per card)**:
`queued | editing | steering | steered | sent | removed`
- **queued** — waiting in the queue. Header `⏳ <preview>` + the message
  preview + actions: `➡️ Steer` (ONLY while a turn runs; when idle omit Steer
  and show a disabled hint), `✏️ Edit` (opens the inline edit form), `🗑️
  Remove` (delete).
- **editing** — the inline edit form is open on THIS card: a single `form`
  with one `input` + a `form_submit` Submit and a Cancel button. Submitting
  returns to `queued` with the new text; Cancel returns to `queued` unchanged.
  NO `input.default_value` (the verified `buildInputCard` shape — a
  `default_value` on the input produced the Feishu 400).
- **steering** — Steer was clicked; waiting for the agent to consume it at its
  step boundary. Shows "💬 Steering…", no buttons.
- **steered** — the agent consumed the steering. Shows "✅ Steered", no
  buttons.
- **sent** — the queued message was delivered as its own turn after the owning
  turn ended (non-steer path). Shows "📤 Sent", no buttons.
- **removed** — the user removed it. Shows "🗑️ Removed", no buttons.

After a terminal state (`steered` / `sent` / `removed`) the card is RETAINED
showing its status marker — never auto-recalled. There is no single shared
card.

**Card/panel shape** — one `buildQueueItemCard(item, running)` per queued
message:
- Header: `⏳ <preview>` (queued) or `⏳ <state label>` (editing/steering/
  steered/sent/removed).
- Body: the message preview, then the status marker (steering/steered/sent/
  removed) or the actions (queued) or the edit form (editing).
- The per-item actions (driving the SURFACE-owned queue, mirroring the web
  `updateQueue`):
  - `queue-steer`: only when a turn runs; take the item out of the surface
    queue then `agent.steer(message)` (the driver consumes it at its NEXT STEP
    boundary — never the `nextTurn` list). Mirrors the web
    `steer-unavailable` guard. Sets the card `steering`; the next
    `user/message` event for that message flips it to `steered`.
  - `queue-edit`: opens the inline edit form (`editing`).
  - `queue-edit-submit`: rewrite the queued content in the surface queue
    (keeping the SAME identity) → `queued`.
  - `queue-edit-cancel`: → `queued` unchanged.
  - `queue-remove`: take the item out of the surface queue → `removed`.

**Queue consumption** — after a turn ends (`turn/end`), the surface drains its
OWN queue: each queued non-steer message is delivered as its own turn
(`beginTurn` → `followup`), which opens a streaming card exactly like a
freshly arrived message. One item is delivered per `turn/end` — delivering the
next immediately would put it in the agent inbox where the loop auto-claims it
without a streaming card — so the chain continues on the next `turn/end`. Each
delivered item is marked `sent` and its retained card updated. A steered
message flows into the running turn via `agent.steer` and is NOT transferred to
a new card; the streaming trace adds a `steering` row where it was injected
(Fix 1), so the user sees exactly the message they steered.

**Streaming trace (steering row)** — when the streaming card receives the
steered message's `user/message` event (source kind `user`, injected mid-turn
by `agent.steer`), the controller adds a `{ kind: 'steering', id, text }` row
to the trace. Collapsed shows the current thinking (or, with no reasoning
text in the turn, the steering row's own line); expanded shows the full
steered message text — the user always sees where their steered message was
inserted.

**Failure modes**:
- No inbox (agent absent / `agent.inbox` unavailable): the message is
  delivered as a normal turn (degrade to today's behavior), logged — never a
  broken queue.
- Steer while idle (`streaming.isWorking(chatId)` false): the button is
  omitted and a disabled hint ("steer unavailable — no turn running") is
  shown; no card action fires.
- Queue item already consumed (turn boundary raced the click): the action
  reports "no longer pending" (a text notice) and, if still `queued`/`editing`,
  marks the item `sent`.
- Card update/post failure: logged; the registry state is unchanged — the next
  mutation re-renders.
- A chat with no pinned cwd: the working-directory gate still refuses the
  FIRST turn; a queued message that reaches a turn picks up the cwd as today.

**Acceptance checklist**:
- [ ] A message sent while a turn runs is queued in the SURFACE queue (not the
      agent inbox `nextTurn`), not delivered as an interrupting turn; it posts
      its OWN item card, and after `turn/end` it is delivered as its own turn
      opening a streaming card (unit + integration).
- [ ] Each queued message gets its own card (one per item); mutations update it
      in place (`updateCard`), never delete+send; no card is ever recalled
      (unit + integration).
- [ ] Every lifecycle state renders the right buttons/marker: queued
      (Steer/Edit/Remove, Steer only while a turn runs), editing (edit form),
      steering ("💬 Steering…"), steered ("✅ Steered"), sent ("📤 Sent"),
      removed ("🗑️ Removed") — the terminal cards have no buttons (unit).
- [ ] Steer while running sets the card `steering`; a later `user/message`
      flips it to `steered`, and the streaming trace shows a `steer` row
      (expanded = the full steered text) (unit).
- [ ] Edit opens the form; submit replaces the text and returns to `queued`;
      cancel returns unchanged; no `input.default_value` (unit).
- [ ] Remove marks the card `removed` and retains it (unit).
- [ ] Agent inbox absent → degrade to a normal turn, logged loudly (unit).
- [ ] The queue item card does not interfere with the streaming card /
      produced chips / stats line (integration).

### Reference

- DSH web `packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/queue/QueueDock.tsx`:
  renders the queue as a dock, `{ kind: 'edit' | 'remove' | 'steer' }` actions
  via `updateQueue`, a collapsible count header (single item renders directly),
  and a `queueMutable` gate when a subagent owns the session.
- DSH web `packages/client/runtime/src/client/sessions/session.ts`
  (`updateQueue`) + `packages/host/apiproxy/src/api-proxy.ts`: the queue
  action mapping — `edit` → `inbox.replace`, else `inbox.remove` then
  `agent.steer(message)` for `steer`; steer requires `target === 'next-turn'`
  AND `agent.status === 'running'` (else `steer-unavailable`). The dsh-feishu
  surface maps these to its OWN queue (the agent inbox is NOT used for
  non-steer queued messages); only `agent.steer` is delegated.
- dsh `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent` `Inbox` (`inbox.d.ts`): `nextTurn` list,
  `append`/`prepend`/`replace`/`remove`/`clear`, and `Agent.steer` (`runtime-types.ts`):
  a running driver consumes steering at its NEXT STEP boundary, never
  mid-step. dsh-feishu uses `agent.steer` only; it never appends non-steer
  queued messages to the inbox.


## Part: model-switch-current

Switch the current session's model immediately when /model picks one (also set the default).

Reference: dsh web's `/model` (client `dsh-client-ui-model-selection` →
`session.selectModel` RPC; host `dsh-host-apiproxy` → `selectionFor(agent)` +
`installModelSelection`, plus `saveDefaultModelSelection`).

### Intended behavior

`/model` (typed `<provider>/<model>` or a picker pick) now does **both** (the
maintainer's "B"):

1. Saves the selection as the **deployment default** (`agentDefaultModel.saveSelection`)
   so future sessions default to it.
2. Couples a mutable `ModelSelection` to the **current session's live agent**
   (`installModelSelection(agent.ctx, ref)` once, then `ref.current = selection`),
   so the NEXT turn in that chat assembles with the picked provider/model.

The reply text is `Model set to <provider> · <model> (this session + default).`

The **read** side (`currentModelSelection`, used by the model picker's current
preselection and the no-catalog `/model` text display) prefers the
session-switched `ref.current` over the live agent's static `options` — a
switch writes the ref but never mutates `agent.options`, so reading `options`
would show the pre-switch model (the `#40 display bug`). It falls back to
`agent.options`, then the deployment default.

### Seam

- `ctx.agentDefaultModel.saveSelection` — default (existing).
- `installModelSelection(agent.ctx, ref)` — per-session switch (runtime import
  from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent`; a deliberate exception to the repo's
  "type-only `@deepseek-ai/*` imports" convention, maintainer decision).
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent` moves to `dependencies`.

### Failure modes

- Live agent absent (no session yet): the switch is a no-op (`applySessionModelSwitch(undefined)`
  returns early); the default is still saved. Reply still reports the model is set.
- `agentDefaultModel` not mounted: `/model` errors (unchanged).
- Future dsh without `installModelSelection`: the import would fail at load;
  documented as version-coupled to the dsh family bump.
